            <p class="content-padded">SpeakEasy is a classroom-based app designed to help you help your students get more comfortable at public speaking! The app will match your students based on their comfort level in public speaking and the strengths/weaknesses that you have evaluated (we'll get to that later) so that they can SpeakEasy ;). Let's get started.</p>
            <p class="content-padded">You will be guided to your homepage, where you can see a list of your classes. From each class page, you will be able to see the data of each student in the class. You can view the number of practices of each of your students and the key feedback they received.</p>
            <p class="content-padded">The messages tab will bring you to your ongoing chats with your students. They will be able to contact you through the app whenever they need help.</p>
            <p class="content-padded">The settings tab will allow you to add classes and change student ratings (you can also change your evaluations of students through individual student profiles).</p>
            <p class="content-padded">If you need a reminder of any of this information, just click the information tab to the right of the Home header.</p>
